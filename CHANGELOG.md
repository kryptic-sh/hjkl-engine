## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.3] - 2026-05-03

### Docs

- Dropped sealed / 14-method rhetoric from the README status section. Per the
  org's "no SPEC frozen claims" stance: the trait surface keeps growing with
  semver-respecting bumps — no value in pinning the count.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-05-03

### Removed

- `SPEC.md` deleted; rustdoc on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/hjkl-engine) is now
  the canonical API reference. All in-source references to `SPEC.md` removed.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-30

### Changed

- Migrated `hjkl-engine` from the `kryptic-sh/hjkl` monorepo into its own
  repository
  ([kryptic-sh/hjkl-engine](https://github.com/kryptic-sh/hjkl-engine)) with
  full git history preserved.
- Relaxed inter-crate dependency requirements from `=0.3.0` to `0.3` (caret),
  matching the standard SemVer pattern for library dependencies.
- Bumped `ratatui` to 0.30 (was 0.29) and `crossterm` to 0.29 (was 0.28).

### Added

- Standalone `LICENSE`, `.gitignore`, and `ci.yml` workflow at the repo root.
